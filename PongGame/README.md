Description: Pong game using Python.
The game provided an interactive and engaging experience for users, featuring a classic two-player gameplay.
Upon launching the game, players were greeted with a visually appealing screen that displayed two paddles,
a screen board, and a ball.
To initiate the game, the user simply needed to press the space key.
One of the paddles was controlled by the player, while the other paddle was autonomously moved by the program,
creating a challenging player versus computer scenario.
The objective of the game was to hit the ball with the paddle,
aiming to outsmart the opponent and score points.
A dynamic scoreboard was incorporated into the screen, constantly updating to reflect the players' scores.
The game provided an intuitive and responsive user interface, allowing players to enjoy a seamless and immersive gaming experience.
One of the key aspects of this project was the implementation of object-oriented programming principles.
I designed the game using classes and objects,
which enabled me to encapsulate the game logic and create modular and reusable code.
